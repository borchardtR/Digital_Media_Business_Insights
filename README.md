# Digital Media Business Analysis

Chinook is a fictional digital music store (similar to iTunes only much smaller). 
The Chinook database can be found [here](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).  
The Chinook database consists of 11 tables, containing customer, employee and invoive/transaction data as well as data on their digital music library (the schema for this database is included near the top of 'Digital_Media_Business_Insights.ipynb'.
<br>


This datasource was introduced in a [database/SQL course](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/).
I have expanded the analysis to include complex querying techniques and to include more business-relevant analysis.
Python is used to better visualize and present the findings.
<br>


The folliowing includes a list of the business questions I answered in this analysis:
1. What percent of Chinook's customer base have spent over \$100 total? What percent of Chinook's total sales do these customers account for?
2. What % of Chinook's customer base returned for additional purchases after their initial purchase? What percent of Chinook's customers can be categorized as "loyalty customers" (have returned for a total of 10 or more separate purchases)?
3. What genres of music should Chinook focus on expanding for USA customers?
4.  How many of the purchases are purchases of an album?
5. What does the employee hierarchical structure look like?
6. How are Chinook's sales support agents performing?
7. What email service providers do our customers use?
8. What does the sales data look like for customers from each country?
9. How do tracks of different length sell? Should Chinook focus on expanding their library of music on tracks of a particular length?
10. What do Chinook's sales trends look like? Are there any trends? Are they growing?


Some of the SQL techniques used in this analysis include:
* subqueries
* views
* joins
* functions
* binning
* recursion
* pattern matching
* set operatins<br>
* indexing
